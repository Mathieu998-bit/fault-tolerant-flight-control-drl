# Deep Reinforcement Learning for a Cessna Citation 500 Flight Controller 
First deep reinforcement learning flight controller for a jet aircraft.
Implemented using the Soft-Actor Critic Algorithm. The goal is to achieve a  multi-type fault-tolerant robust control.

Research conducted as part of the MSc Thesis at Delft University of Technology.
